Guys I need help, 2 weeks ago I downloaded Minecraft on my computer just for kicks
cause I haven't played video games in a few years and loved it when I was 12 and
now I'm addicted and can't stop playing. I've already lost my job and have been
kicked out of my house because of it. I haven't eaten in 3 days because any time
away from Minecraft is ridiculous. I lost my girlfriend because I was too busy playing
Minecraft to notice her texts and calls. Lost my entire music career because I had to
delete FL Studio to make room for Minecraft so it would run faster. And lost my car
because I left it unlocked and didn't pay attention to who asked me for my keys cause
I was too busy defeating the enderdragon. My parents call me a disappointment but they
simply just don't understand. Nobody understands.
